# TriplifierJS

## Description
Triplifier is a tool for semantic web. It is used to convert CSV to triplets that can be used in triple store as Jena Fuseki and so on.

This was a school project so I probably won't update this often, but feel free to use it and contact me if you have any suggestion for improving it.

## Test data
I do not own any of the csv used for test. They can be found here:

- csv_1: Iris dataset

- csv_2: World cities from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juanmah/world-cities)

- csv_3: Grocery items, also on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset)
